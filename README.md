Palabrapp v. 1.0

PalabrApp is a webapp designed to let users create, solve and share puzzles made by spanish words and their definitions.

Visit the deployed version at https://palabrapp.netlify.app/


Puzzles are automatically generated after the user provides a single word, taking each letter and pairing it with one of a random word from the database.

The words and definitions database was generated by a scrapy bot I made, you can see the code here: https://github.com/SantiagoJavierRubio/diccionario


To do list:
- Make the app more mobile friendly
- Allow to "lock" words when creating a puzzle
- Show definitions when creating a puzzle
- Allow for better user profile customization (avatar, colors, puzzle display, follow/befriend other users)
